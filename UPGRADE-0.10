Upgrade from 0.08 or earlier instructions:

Some changes in API have been made since 0.08. If you have an older version
than 0.10, you _have_ to upgrade you code before installing this version.

Major changes are in ""directive()"" and ""section()"" methods. They no longer
return an array ref where called in scalar context, but the latest item of
the list.

You are encouraged to modify your code, but, I know this can take a lot of
time so you can activate the compatibility mode by call the contructor method 
""new()"" with the argument ""-oldapi"" like this :

    my $obj = new Apache::Admin::Config ('/path/to/file', -oldapi=>1);

Others changes in the new API shouldn't disturb your programs, so if you
find any problem, please contact me at <rs@rhapsodyk.net>.
