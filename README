NAME
    Apache::Admin::Config - A module to read/write Apache like configuration
    files

DESCRIPTION
    "Apache::Admin::Config" provides an object oriented interface for
    reading and writing Apache-like configuration files without affecting
    comments, indentation, or truncated lines.

    You can easily extract informations from the apache configuration, or
    manage htaccess files.

    I wrote this class because I work for an IPP, and we often manipulate
    apache configuration files for adding new clients, activate some
    features or un/locking directories using htaccess, etc. It can also be
    useful for writing some one-shoot migrations scripts in few lines.
